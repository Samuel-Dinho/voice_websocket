## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: HSL(48, 73%, 51%) which converts to a golden yellow RGB hex value: #E2AC2D. This hue and saturation suits the themes of global connection and intellect, while avoiding visual cliches. Its relative darkness enables its suitability as a primary color on the selected light color scheme.
- Background color: HSL(48, 18%, 94%) which converts to a pale ivory RGB hex value: #F5F3ED. This color echoes the golden hue of the primary color, and because of its desaturation, it sits quietly in the background.
- Accent color: HSL(18, 79%, 47%) which converts to a deep coral RGB hex value: #D4621D. The warm hue is still harmonious, but the difference in saturation makes this color ideal for drawing attention to certain user interface elements.
- Body: 'Inter' sans-serif, for a clean modern appearance.
- Headline: 'Space Grotesk' sans-serif, to add some character to larger-sized text.
- Use clean, modern icons to represent different languages and settings.
- Subtle transitions and animations to provide feedback during audio capture and translation.
